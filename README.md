# Author
The primary author and primary maintainer of this code is Jean-Baptiste
"JBQ" "Djaybee" Queru, member of the Megabusters demo crew.

# License
This repository is licensed under GPLv3, because I feel that there's
so little software available for this hardware that I'm willing to force
people to share their derivative work.

# Privacy (GDPR)
This software doesn't handle any personal data, by virtue of having
no identifiers and no information that would allow to identify anyone.
I don't recommend that you modify this software to handle personal data,
but, if you do, that'll make you the controller for GDPR purposes.

# Cybersecurity (CRA)
This software doesn't have any direct or indirect network connections.
Additionally, it is non-commercial Open Source, out of CRA scope.
The development process stops at "it works on one emulator" and is
far from modern best practices. I don't recommend that you modify this
software for use in an environment where cybersecurity is important,
but, if you do, that'll be considered a significant modification
for CRA purposes.

# Development environment
This software is developed against [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/).
